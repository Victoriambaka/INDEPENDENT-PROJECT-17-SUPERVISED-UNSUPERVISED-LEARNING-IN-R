# INDEPENDENT-PROJECT-17-SUPERVISED-UNSUPERVISED-LEARNING-IN-R

This is a project done in the 17th week of the Moringa School Data Science curriculum.
The files presented include workings on both Supervised and Unsupervised learning. Under Supervised learning (PART 1) K- Nearest neighbour and Regression models were worked onto the previous project (INDEPENDENT - PROJECT - 16: link) while under the Unsupervised learning, k-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering methods were covered.

How to run the code:
The document can be run locally on RStudio

This project was done, mainly to facilitate learning and practice during the sessions of the course.

Much of the learning had been done during the week and was facilitated by technical mentors.

Below are the links to the publications of the documents.
